# Summary

The development of QuickER aimed to streamline the emergency room (ER) experience for patients and healthcare providers. The project focused on reducing wait times, improving patient satisfaction, and optimizing the intake process in hospitals through a user-friendly mobile application.

# Problem

Patients with non-life-threatening conditions often face long wait times and a cumbersome intake process in emergency rooms. This results in patient dissatisfaction and inefficiencies for healthcare providers.

### Product Successes

Users appreciated the reduced wait times, improved satisfaction, and optimized intake process. The app's intuitive design and user-friendly features were particularly praised by users. QuickER was regarded as the best UI/UX case in the course and was recommended to be presented at CS Day, highlighting its success and potential impact.

### What I Learned

Through this project, I learned the importance of user-centered design and iterative development. The experience taught me how to effectively gather and incorporate user feedback to create a product that meets the needs of its users. Additionally, I gained valuable skills in collaborating with a team and managing a project from concept to completion. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also enriched my ability to drive impactful change through thoughtful design and strategic thinking.
