# Summary

The Amaze Games AR Filter TikTok series is a collection of interactive TikTok game filters built using Effect House. These augmented reality (AR) games are designed to engage users with fast, reflex-based challenges that blends nostalgia, humor, and social competitiveness. This initiative is part of Amaze Games, a creative extension of the Amaze brand focused on delivering lightweight, viral-ready gaming experiences through social platforms.

# Problem

Most TikTok filters are either purely visual or static. Users engage with them briefly but rarely return. There’s a missed opportunity to turn filters into repeatable micro games that are fun, shareable, and spark community interaction. I saw a growing demand for TikTok-native games that were simple, intuitive, and exciting enough to keep users coming back while also sharing with others.

❓ How can we create TikTok filters that feel like actual games that are playable and viral with built-in feedback loops to encourage sharing and continued use?

# Solution

The solution was to use Effect House to develop a series of AR game filters. These include fast-tap challenges, reflex timers, face gesture games, and playful mini-games like “Tickle the Foot” or “Hold Your Breath.” Each game is designed with a strong visual identity, sound effects, and win/lose feedback for high replayability.

💡 Include time-based scoring, animations, and clear success/fail states to encourage competition and replays.

<aside>
💡 Design for short, engaging experiences (under 10 seconds) to match TikTok’s fast-consumption format.

### User Research

User research focused on analyzing the most successful game filters on TikTok and identifying patterns in what makes people play again, share, or tag friends. I studied trending effects, user comments, and engagement metrics on TikTok game filters to determine what types of interaction drive the most traction.

<aside>
👉 Studied top-performing TikTok filters to define common viral traits: speed, humor, simplicity, and instant visual payoff.

</aside>

### Sketches

Early sketches focused on creating concepts that felt unique but required no onboarding. These included facial gesture games (smile to win), tap challenges, and reaction-based games. Each idea was designed to fit TikTok’s UI and user behavior.

<aside>
👉 Mapped out over 10 filter ideas based on physical reflexes and simple touch gestures, choosing the most intuitive for development.

</aside>

### Wireframes / Prototypes

Effect House prototypes were built using behavior scripting, collision triggers, and face tracking. I tested animations, feedback sounds, and on-screen UI timers to ensure players understood the challenge immediately.

<aside>
👉 Built working prototypes in Effect House and tested directly on-device, optimizing for speed and instant player understanding.

</aside>

### Usability Study

I posted early versions of filters for private testing and had creators, friends, and followers try them. Feedback focused on timing, clarity of instructions, and how fun it felt in the first 5 seconds.

<aside>
👉 Shortened timer delays and added start countdowns after users reported confusion about when the game started.

# Major Design Iterations

### - Iteration 1.

Initial filters were too visual and lacked game logic. This version focused on aesthetics but failed to deliver lasting engagement.

### - Iteration 2.

I added game mechanics like timers, triggers, and scoring using Effect House scripting. Now users could win or lose, and content felt more interactive.

### - Iteration 3.

Introduced a consistent branded overlay, sound feedback, win/lose animations, and planned a content rollout strategy. Filters became shareable and replayable, and engagement noticeably increased.

### Product Successes

### What I Learned

This project taught me how to design for micro interactions games that are instantly understandable, visually rewarding, and optimized for viral spread. I deepened my knowledge of Effect House’s scripting tools, collision systems, and face tracking logic, while developing a new instinct for TikTok-native design.
