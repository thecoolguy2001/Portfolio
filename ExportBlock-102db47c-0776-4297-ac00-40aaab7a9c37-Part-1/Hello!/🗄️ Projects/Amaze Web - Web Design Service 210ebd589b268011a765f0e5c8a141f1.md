# Summary

The Amaze Web design service is a offering of digital products ranging from website theme templates using Framer and Shopify, to AI Automation Kits and Email Design Services delivered to business owners and creators. It’s designed to empower creators and small businesses with great design and automation tools at fixed prices, with no ongoing maintenance commitments. 

# Problem

Many early entrepreneurs, indie brands, and small businesses lack access to high quality design assets, email templates, and automation workflows that they can deploy immediately without the overhead of lengthy contracts, subscriptions, or technical setup. I personally noticed this as many people I know and seen online express this as a major pain point for their brand or business to get to the next level.

The solution was to create four core product lines which are Framer Themes, Shopify Themes, AI Automation Kits, and Email Design Services. Each service is sold as a fixed-price download with every product including clear documentation and optional one-time setup assistance letting users get up and running in minutes.

### User Research

User research first involved me looking to what were the most common websites that were in demand for all kinds of businesses. This was done by looking into Shopify themes and also looking at market for other developers selling website themes through platforms like Fiverr and more. This research allowed me to position myself correctly into the market and offer exactly what users want and expect from a typical web service.

### Sketches

Preliminary sketches involved creating and drafting different template layouts and styles. Being sure to have multiple iterations and versions for each theme that needed to be made. Sketches were also designed with all previous research and experience to ensure optimal design for the users.

Explored multiple layout variations per theme, using research-backed sketches to balance aesthetic appeal with usability and conversion goals.

### Wireframes / Prototypes

Wireframes for the themes and its storefront/model were done to ensure everything is correctly in line to have a smooth deployment for service. Also keeping in mind needing to document everything necessary for the clients for clarification on anything they need.

### Usability Study

To ensure Amaze Web products were genuinely useful and easy to implement, I conducted informal usability tests and feedback sessions with early clients and creators. These sessions revealed common friction points, such as confusion around theme installation, lack of customization clarity, and setup steps that felt too technical for non-developers.

# Major Design Iterations

### - Iteration 1.

Amaze Web began as a direct response to early client needs brands and creators who needed polished, fast-turnaround websites without the high cost of long-term web retainers. I worked closely with these clients to understand their visual identity, brand goals, and pain points, building custom websites from scratch to match their vision.

### - Iteration 2.

After recognizing patterns in what most clients were asking for, I shifted toward building reusable, scalable solutions in the form of Framer and Shopify templates. These templates allowed me to offer faster, more affordable builds while still preserving the custom feel. Each theme was designed with creative flexibility and conversion in mind, reducing time-to-launch for both me and the client.

### - Iteration 3.

Currently, I’m expanding Amaze Web into service kits that go beyond design—introducing AI-powered automation systems and fully designed email templates for platforms like Shopify Email. These offerings are built to give users powerful backend systems with the same plug-and-play simplicity as my themes, enabling creators and small brands to launch with both visual polish and operational efficiency.

### Product Successes

Launched a multi-product digital storefront featuring Framer themes, Shopify templates, email design kits, and AI automation tools. The product templates drove a 40% increase in user conversion interest during pre-launch testing by optimizing product structure. Optimizing clients site building by simplifying setup guides and offering one-time-install options. I also received highly positive feedback from early users, who praised the polished design, clarity of documentation, and plug-and-play usability across all offerings. With all being said, I am positioning Amaze Web as a creative-first alternative to traditional freelance web services and enabling passive income through scalable one-click digital tools.

### What I Learned

Building Amaze Web taught me how to turn early client feedback and market research into a clear and scalable product strategy. By studying the needs of initial clients with what they struggled with, what they valued most, and how they interacted with design systems I was able to create a flexible product/service that not only solved real problems but elevated brand identity for future users.

This experience sharpened my ability to think like both a designer and a customer by positioning each product to deliver immediate value while maintaining a strong creative standard. I’m continuing to gather insights from user interactions and evolving the platform in real time to streamline onboarding, add new features, and improve the overall experience for growing brands.
