In the first iteration, we focused on improving the homepage and menu by streamlining the content and removing redundant pages. This effort aimed to enhance the user experience by making navigation more intuitive and ensuring that users could easily find the information they were seeking. The streamlined content provided a clear and concise presentation of the studio's offerings, setting a solid foundation for further enhancements.

The second iteration involved adding additional information to the homepage to provide users with an instant highlight reel of the production company's key features and services. This included incorporating eye-catching visuals and concise descriptions that effectively communicated the studio's unique value proposition. The goal was to immediately engage visitors and provide a compelling overview of what the studio has to offer, thereby increasing user interest and retention.

In the third iteration, we focused on improving the overall color scheme of the website and implementing an enhanced photo gallery design. The updated color palette aimed to create a more visually appealing and cohesive aesthetic that aligned with the studio's brand identity. Additionally, the improved photo gallery design ensured that users could easily view and appreciate the company’s photos and experiences. This enhancement not only improved the visual appeal of the site but also provided a more user-friendly experience, making it easier for visitors to explore the studio’s work.

# Final Design

### Product Successes

The redesign of both the brand and website was met with highly positive reception from both the team and the studio community. The introduction of modern design elements and a refreshed aesthetic significantly enhanced the studio's online presence. This transformation not only improved the overall user experience but also elevated the studio's perceived prestige. As a result, the studio attracted higher-profile clients and garnered increased attention from industry figures, further solidifying its reputation as a leading production studio.

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned how to effectively collaborate with a company that is less tech-oriented, successfully delivering on their goals and mission to redesign their website and enhance their brand identity. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and clear communication when working with clients from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, I gained valuable skills in connecting and networking with individuals who not only elevated my professional growth but also imparted essential lessons in teamwork and collaboration.

By conducting thorough and thoughtful research, I developed a deeper understanding of how to improve a brand and a company. This involved analyzing user feedback, market trends, and industry standards to create a design that resonated with the target audience. I learned how to translate the company's vision into a cohesive and visually appealing online presence that met their strategic objectives. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also enriched my ability to drive impactful change through user-centered design and strategic thinking.
